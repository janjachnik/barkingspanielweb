          Barking best is our best bitter. Mahogany coloured and made with mostly Maris Otter malt with a dash of black malt. We use classic East Kent Goldings hops combined with Willamette hops: a US variety derived from English Fuggles.

  - name: 'Barking at the Moon'
    description: >
          This wheat beer takes inspiration from Belgian Witbiers. Infused with coriander seed, bitter orange peel and fresh root ginger it is best enjoyed cold on a hot summer's day. A refreshing beer with a low hop character, letting the spices shine through.
