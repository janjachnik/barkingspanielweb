          Barking best is our best bitter. Mahogany coloured and made with mostly Maris Otter malt with a dash of black malt. We use classic East Kent Goldings hops combined with Willamette hops: a US variety derived from English Fuggles.

          This wheat beer takes inspiration from Belgian Witbiers. Infused with coriander seed, bitter orange peel and fresh root ginger it is best enjoyed cold on a hot summer's day. A refreshing beer with a very low amount of hops in comparison the the rest of our range.

            Oatmeal Stout was one of the first beer styles brewed by Jan, our Head Brewer.  
            The addition of oats in the grist give this rich stout a wonderfully silky mouthfeel which excellently complements the bitterness from the roasted malts and English hops.
