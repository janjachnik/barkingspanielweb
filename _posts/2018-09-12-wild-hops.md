Whilst taking the second barking spaniel for a run today I stumbled across some wild hops in a hedgerow.
I think I'll have to head back and collect some for a wild hop beer sometime in the near future!

When using wild hops in a brew it's best to use them for aroma (assuming they have a good aroma!) because there is no easy way to determine the bitterness levels in the hops.
I've also noticed that the hop flavour is subtly different when the hops are added fresh as opposed to dry, with fresh hops giving a more grassy, "green" taste.
Several years ago I was lucky enough to be in Seattle during the hop harvesting season and was able to taste a great selection of fresh-hop beers. Yummy.
