A week ago we had to say goodbye to Cookie, our wonderful Cocker Spaniel after which the brewery is named. For the last few years he had been battling with chronic pancreatitis and it finally got the better of him. He will be sorely missed but his memory will live on in the Barking Spaniel Brewery.
