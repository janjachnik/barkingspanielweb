title: Another Barking Spaniel

A few weeks ago we welcomed another rescue spaniel named Florence into the Barking Spaniel team. Florence has been used for breeding her entire life and she is now super happy to be free to do what doggies should be doing. That means lots of play times and cuddles.

Cookie is still trying to teach Florence that she should bark at anything that comes past but so far she is being very nonchalant. However, she will have a good bark at the washing machine.
