## Barking Best
<div class="row"><div class="col-sm-8">
Barking best is our best bitter. Mahogany coloured and made with mostly Maris Otter malt with a dash of black malt. We use classic East Kent Goldings hops combined with Willamette hops which is a US variety derived from English Fuggles.

## Barking at the Moon
<div class="row"><div class="col-sm-8">
This wheat beer takes inspiration from the traditional Belgian Witbier. Infused with coriander seed, bitter orange peel and fresh root ginger it is best enjoyed cold. A refreshing beer with a very low amount of hops in comparison the the rest of our range.

## Dark Bark
<div class="row"><div class="col-sm-8">
Oatmeal Stout was one of the first beer styles brewed by Jan, our Head Brewer.  
The addition of oats in the grist give this rich stout a wonderfully silky mouthfeel which excellently complements the bitterness from the roasted malts and English hops.
