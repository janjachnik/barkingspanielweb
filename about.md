We are a nano-scale brewery in the Wiltshire village of Lea. 
Our goal is to make easy-drinking beers with traditional roots but a modern twist.

The brewery is named after Cookie, our Cocker Spaniel rescue. He makes an excellent guard dog by constantly barking at any strangers or people who walk past the house.
